constexpr: this keyword declares that an object or a function can be evaluated at compile time

//constexpr int square(int x) {

//int main() {
//    constexpr int result = square(5); // evaluated at compile time

/*
In this example, the function square() is declared as constexpr, allowing it to be evaluated at compile time. The variable result is also declared as constexpr, so its value is computed at compile time. This is evaluated before the program even starts executing.
